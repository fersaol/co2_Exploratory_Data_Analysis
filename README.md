## About the Dataset:

Contains the following features:

* Country - Country in question  
* Energy_type - Type of energy source  
* Year - Year the data was recorded  
* Energy_consumption - Amount of Consumption for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)  
* Energy_production - Amount of Production for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)  
* GDP - Countries GDP at purchasing power parities, measured (Billion 2015$ PPP)  
* Population - Population of specific Country, measured (Mperson)  
* Energyintensityper_capita - Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy     per   unit of capita (capita = individual person), measured (MMBtu/person)  
* Energyintensityby_GDP- Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit   of GDP, measred (1000 Btu/2015$ GDP PPP)  
* CO2_emission - The amount of C02 emitted, measured (MMtonnes CO2)  

The data was obtained from Kaggle which got it from the US Energy administration. The data goes from the 1980 to the 2019
